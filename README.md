# shootydot-v1
The original shootydot, or whatever's left of it.

I thought this code was gone. But I found it. Somewhere. I wrote it so long ago. Before I knew how to use git, or yarn, or that I could just do `require("./codes.json")`. This code is awful. But I'm not ashamed of it. In a year, the code I'm writing right now will seem awful. Failure is the best indicator of progress.

Please. Don't use this. Ever. It's awful. The only reason I've uploaded it is because it holds some sentimental value to me, and also I somehow figured out how to do the correct trigonometry functions back then for movement, which I now need. I knew nothing about trigonometry, and I somehow managed to teach myself. At least it worked a little. Anyway, here you go. This is what my code looked like a few years ago. It might not even have been a few years. It's probably a lot more recent than it feels.
